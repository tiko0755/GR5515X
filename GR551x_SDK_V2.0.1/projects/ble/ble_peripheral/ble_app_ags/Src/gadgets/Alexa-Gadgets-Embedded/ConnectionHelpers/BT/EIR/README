The bluetooth_eir.c contains methods to generate the EIR data using the following API:

#Specification:
https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-gadgets-toolkit/classic-bluetooth-settings.html#eir

void construct_gadget_eir(uint8_t* buffer, uint8_t* p_len, const char* gadget_name, uint16_t pid, uint16_t vid);

uint8_t* buffer
The input buffer to the API that will poppulated with the EIR that needs to be
provided to the BT stack for providing inquiry responses to the host trying to perform
inquiry scans on the gadget

uint8_t* p_len
Input pointer to the length. This pointer will point to the actual number of bytes in the buffer
containing the EIR data

const char* name
The gadget bluetooth friendly name

uint16_t pid
The two byte Product ID

uint16_t vid
The two byte Vendor ID


Files:
bluetooth_eir.h
Contains various macros and constants required in creation of the EIR

bluetooth_eir.c
Contains the implementation of EIR
Also, contains main() function for sample call to the API

Compilation and Execution
To compile the code using gcc:
gcc bluetooth_eir.c -o bluetooth_eir
