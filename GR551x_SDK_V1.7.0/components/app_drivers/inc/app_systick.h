 * @note   This function is called at the beginning of program after reset and before
 *         the clock configuration.
 *         The Systick configuration is based on AHB clock and the NVIC configuration
 *         is set to Priority group 4.
 *         The time base configuration is done, time base tick starts incrementing.
 *         In the default implementation, Systick is used as source of time base.
 *         The tick variable is incremented each 1ms in its ISR.
